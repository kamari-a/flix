# Flix
A YouTube inspired Single Page Application built using React.js, Sass, Node.js and Express.js.

# Context
This responsive SPA allows users to view a selection of videos and their associated description and comments. Users can post comments to each individual video, as well as upload their own video to the platform.

# Instructions

# Next Steps
Next steps for this project are to:
- Add the ability for users to upload a video/image to the platform. Currently the video upload functionality automatically populates the video with a hardcoded placeholder image.
- Add a function to count the number on comments on each video
