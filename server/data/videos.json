        "description": "Tiësto has ushered dance music into one new era after another. He began as an originator of the genre known as “trance,” but bringing an entire genre into the global spotlight wasn’t enough. His music evolved from Progressive House to more club-centric hits, and now to an exciting new blend of radio-ready dance music. Along the way, he scored a platinum single in the US with “Wasted” [feat. Matthew Koma] as “Red Lights” went gold. Beyond sales achievements, he garnered a Grammy® for the Best Remixed Recording for his rework of John Legend’s “All Of Me” in 2015. Fellow legends such as Beyoncé, Coldplay, and Kanye West continue to tap him for remixes as well.",
